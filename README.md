# 📘 Math 104 — Applied Matrix Theory  
### *Online Notes & Learning Repository*

Welcome to my personal notebook for **Math 104: Applied Matrix Theory** (Stanford University, Fall 2025).  
This repository contains my lecture notes, topic summaries, worked examples, and supplemental materials—all written to strengthen my understanding of linear algebra and matrix theory.

The site is automatically built using **GitHub Pages**, **Jekyll**, and **MathJax**, making the notes readable, searchable, and accessible online.

## 📚 About This Project

This repository serves two purposes:

### **1. My online study notebook**  
A place to organize everything I learn in Math 104—cleanly written, LaTeX-formatted, and structured for long-term reference.

### **2. A resource for other students**  
Although the content is written for my own learning, I hope it can help anyone studying linear algebra, matrix theory, or related topics.

All explanations and summaries are written by me.  
I use AI tools **only for formatting, LaTeX assistance, and structural improvements**, not for providing copyrighted content.
