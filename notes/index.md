# Lecture Notes & Summaries

These notes summarize and expand upon topics covered in Math 104 lectures.  
All explanations are written by me, and I use AI tools to assist with formatting, typesetting, and improving clarity—especially for LaTeX and structure.  

I do **not** claim ownership of any copyrighted material referenced, and no copyrighted text is reproduced here. All summaries are my own understanding of the material.
